I am Samee. I currently work at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) in the Bay Area, California. I grew up in Pakistan and went to university in Europe (Germany/the Netherlands).
	I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and did a PhD on the [extension of Bayesian optimization to solve robust optimization problems](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:b963b8c4-49c9-446b-8128-358a301d12e3).
