I am Samee. I have spent my life being what you might call a "janitor of science". I have worked at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) since 2015 and currently live in the Bay Area, California. I grew up in Pakistan and went to university in Europe (Germany/the Netherlands).
	I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My PhD was on the [extension of Bayesian optimization to solve robust optimization problems](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:b963b8c4-49c9-446b-8128-358a301d12e3).

I love the creative process and get energy from starting original projects. I like using our collective innovative skills to help build a better future. I enjoy working on AI, Machine Learning, Physical Modeling, Optimization, and complex engineering problems.
