**Agents for Engineering Design and Operations**


The process of building and maintaining engineering systems, from relatively simple ones like the first car engine to missions like the apollo 11, has remained more or less the same over the last century. You start with the question of what you want to build, hopefully based on what people want. Senior system engineers write down the requirements of the system in terms of performance and design. These then get cascaded down into component level performance and design requirements. Engineers get to work in building the solutions at component and system level.
