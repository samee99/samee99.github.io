**Agentic AI for Engineering: From Design to Maintenance**

**How engineering organizations build engineering systems today**

The process of building and maintaining engineering systems, from relatively simple ones like a bicycle to missions like the Apollo 11, has remained more or less the same over the last century. 

You start with the question of what you want to build, hopefully based on what people want. System engineers write down the requirements of the system in terms of performance and design. These then get cascaded down into component level performance and design requirements. 

Engineers get to work building the solutions at component and system level. Junior design engineers work at component level to execute on requirements that have been cascaded down to them. The junior engineers define the architecture, the detailed design and start perform computer aided design/engineering/simulations to design the components. Similar processes are followed by engineers responsible for manufacturing the components and systems: creating tests needed to verify performance, executing them and documenting the results. 

The system is then deployed in the field and customer support engineers constantly review the logs produced by the system once it is deployed, ensuring it performs as it should, finding the root cause in case of issues, while simultaneously thinking about what to change so that the problems don't occur again. This process continues until the system reaches the end of its lifetime. 

Along this journey, all the stakeholders in the organization regularly attend meetings and communicate with each other to verify with their stakeholders that they are on the right path and to make changes in case of changing requirements. 

Engineering companies are typically organized in response to the system definition, implementation, testing and integration process, starting from research to development to manufacturing and customer support. Each of these organizations hire thousands of engineers who are constantly working within their scope while ensuring that they communicate with their stakeholders so that the full system runs and operates as required.

**The problem**
The process of designing physical engineering systems requires human labor that is expensive, hard to train, hard to replace and varying in motivation/competence. The pace at which an engineering organization builds these systems is gated by human labor. The learning cycle of design, implementation, validation and maintenance is therefore also limited by human labor. 

**The solution**
AI agents like Claude Code and coding assistants like Cursor/Github copilot are helping software engineers write code faster. AI agents can similarly act as copilots for engineers across the full lifecycle of physical engineering system design and maintenance. Here are a few examples of how: 

1. In the design phase, AI Agents can help engineers write and revise requirement documents. These agents will likely requiring agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) solutions to surface the write content for the engineer. 
2. In the implementation phase, AI agents can Perform simulations autonomously using CAD/CAE tools by searching through tool documentation and calling relevant APIs with the right configurations. 
3. Parse through logs to identify root cause errors when the systems are deployed. Again this involves agentic RAG or GraphRAG solutions to assist customer support engineers to handle system performance issues. 

In addition, Agentic AI can identify when there is value in building surrogate models to replace the slow and expensive CAD/CAE tools and help with the initial Design of Experiments and active learning methods required to optimally sample the space to find optimal designs efficiently. 

While AI agents will eventually disrupt the organizational structure of corporations currently building and maintaining engineering systems, the process will still start with having intern level agents that complement human engineers as they execute low tasks.
