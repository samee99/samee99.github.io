**Agents for Engineering Design and Operations**


The process of building and maintaining engineering systems, from relatively simple ones like the first car engine to missions like the apollo 11, has remained more or less the same over the last century. 

You start with the question of what you want to build, hopefully based on what people want. Senior system engineers write down the requirements of the system in terms of performance and design. These then get cascaded down into component level performance and design requirements. 

Engineers get to work building the solutions at component and system level. They define the component/system level architecture and the detailed design and start implementing. Once the design is ready, integration tests and verifications happen at the component and system level. After the performance of the system is validated, it is deployed in the field and maintained till the end of its lifetime. 

**The problem**
This process is highly labor intensive and slow. Junior design engineers work at component level to execute on requirements that have been cascaded down to them by senior system engineers. They would typically perform a combination of writing documentation on the architecture as well as performing computer aided design/engineering/simulations to design the components. This is in addition to the meetings they would attend to verify with their stakeholders that they are on the right path. Similar processes are followed by engineers responsible for manufacturing the components and systems: documenting tests needed to verify performance, executing them and
