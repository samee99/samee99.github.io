With the launch of the internet, information became free. With recent improvements in [language, vision and mult-modal models](https://openai.com/research/overview), the cost of intelligence is going down. 
Language models like GPT-4 not only compress information but also allow users to access it at different levels of understanding. 
A 9 year old can ask GPT-4 to explain the theory of relativity to a 9 year old and receive an age appropriate response. 
GPT-4 today can act as a personal instructor on arbitrary topics, and can (sometimes) judge correctness of human responses. 
Even itâ€™s propensity to hallucinate is a feature as opposed to a bug in education as that keeps students engaged and present 
to identify mistakes. This shift should propel us to rethink how to build a digital education institution of the future 
and here is an attempt to do just that. 

To teach you need content (information) and a teacher. To assess whether the information was transferred you need a test. 
In the year 2,000, a 9 year old could already access content on the web and 
could find web pages that could (partially) test his knowledge. 
The missing link was the teacher. 
An agent that could guide his reasoning, clear his confusions, calm him if he felt overwhelmed and challenge him 
with new content if he was bored.

Such an education institution of the future should be seen primarily as a **Software as a Service**. At the core of it is content, delivery of that content, and the creation of an environment that optimally enables that delivery. Google surfaced information we needed (Content). Facebook virtually connected us with others (Connection). 

Metaverse, questionable but valuable. 

Redundancy in tests to ensure that you got it. 
No one teacher can know everything (mentioning 17 year doubling of knowledge here). 
This can be partially solve by focusing on fundamentals. 
But somebody needs to help you connect the dots as well. 
If knowledge is a tree, you need the trunk (fundamentals), 
and understand how the leaves connect to the trunk and to one another. 
(See knowledge as a grid, going down that grid takes you deeper, ) 

Khan Academy partially filled the void for school going students. 

Education 1.0 (Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
OLPC (failed project, alone, no guidance, no peer group), 
Learning how to learn
Education 2.0 (Cohorts, peer group, AI-driven and human assisted)
