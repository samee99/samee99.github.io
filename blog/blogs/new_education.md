With the launch of the internet, information became free. With recent improvements in [language, vision and multi-modal models](https://openai.com/research/overview), the cost of intelligence is going down. 
Language models like GPT-4 not only compress information but also allow users to access it at different levels of understanding. 
A 9 year old can ask GPT-4 to explain the theory of relativity to a 9 year old and receive an age appropriate response. 
GPT-4 today can act as a personal instructor on arbitrary topics, and can (sometimes) judge correctness of human responses. 
Even it’s propensity to hallucinate is a feature as opposed to a bug in education as that keeps students engaged and present 
to identify mistakes. This shift should propel us to rethink how to build a digital education institution of the future 
and here is an attempt to do just that. 

To contextualize what we are talking about, I am going to use the framework of a communication system to help visualize what education looks like today and then extrapolate this analogy to build the new education system we would like.

Viewed through this lense, we can identify obvious issues and bottlenecks in the traditional classroom setting: 

* **Single source but multiple different receivers**: One teacher tries to transfer the same message to multiple students at once.   
* **Limited and high latency feedback**: Only one student can communicate at a time with the teacher to give feedback (e.g. related to confusions). 
* **Inability to account for unique channel capacity:** Students with high channel capacity (better attention, memory, prior knowledge, motivation) can decode the message easily giving the false impression that all students, with varying abilities, have understood it. 
* **One size fits all encoding strategy** Similarly, the same textbook or lecture notes would be used for all students not accounting for individual decoding ability. 
* **Channel overload:** The information is often transferred too quickly for students to absorb, resulting in them feeling overwhelmed.  
* **Lack of redundancy** Concepts are not communicated in multiple ways leading to gap in understanding. 

The most robust system in this case would be one that dilutes the message complexity so that the receiver with the lowest channel capacity can receive it in full. However, not everything is broken in this system. Receivers (students) can communicate with one another to confirm that they received the correct message. This peer learning not only solidifies concepts but also engenders camaraderie and social cohesion. Regular class schedules, particularly in schools, help students learn to manage time and teach them how to follow a routine. 



To teach you need content (information) and a teacher. To assess whether the information was transferred you need a test. 
In the year 2,000, a 9 year old could already access content on the web and 
could find web pages that could (partially) test his knowledge. 
The missing link was the teacher. 
An agent that could guide his reasoning, clear his confusions, calm him if he felt overwhelmed and challenge him 
with new content if he was bored.

Such an education institution of the future should be seen primarily as a **Software as a Service**. At the core of it is content, delivery of that content, and the creation of an environment that optimally enables that delivery. Google surfaced information we needed (Content). Facebook virtually connected us with others (Connection). 

Metaverse, questionable but valuable. 

Cost of intelligence going down is particularly exciting for the developing world. The gap between the rich and the poor cannot be filled by giving goods to the poor, it's filled by teaching them how to create those goods. Consider the hypothetical example of a society facing a war and the leader of this society is selfish and greedy. The leader is given the choice that either the people will remain but the physical infrastructure would be destroyed or the people would be killed but the physical infrastructure would stay intact. As an example, imagine that somebody were to destroy an industralized society to dust while leaving its people alive. Those people would build that society back based on their individual and societal knowledge. However, imagine that all the people in that society got killed while the physical goods and infrastrture remained intact. A new people would took over, but they would find it harder to reverse engineer the goods they use. Secondly their productive capacity would be limited by their lack of knowledge, which would mean that unless they learn how to keep making those goods, the goods would run dry, leading to a fall in overall wealth. So even from a selfish, greedy perspective, the leader should choose to prioritize the safety of the people. 

Redundancy in tests to ensure that you got it. 
No one teacher can know everything (mentioning 17 year doubling of knowledge here). 
This can be partially solve by focusing on fundamentals. 
But somebody needs to help you connect the dots as well. 
If knowledge is a tree, you need the trunk (fundamentals), 
and understand how the leaves connect to the trunk and to one another. 
(See knowledge as a grid, going down that grid takes you deeper, ) 

Khan Academy partially filled the void for school going students. 

Education 1.0 (Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
OLPC (failed project, alone, no guidance, no peer group), 
Learning how to learn
Education 2.0 (Cohorts, peer group, AI-driven and human assisted)
