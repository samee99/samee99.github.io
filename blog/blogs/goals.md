**Your career is your business and you are it’s CEO - Andy Grove.** 

***“I highly recommend using lists. I make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day. Lists are very focusing, and they help me with multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head. If I’m not in the mood for some particular task, I can always find something else I’m excited to do.” - Sam Altman Blog***

1. ***Think of something it would be worthwhile to do right now, without any expectation that you know what might be "best". (And don't forget that it could be "take a nap"!)***
2. ***Write it down.***
3. ***Do that thing.***
4. ***Cross it out.***
5. ***Go back to 1., writing the next thing underneath the one you just crossed out. Repeat (forever). -* https://www.oliverburkeman.com/onething** 

*The real lesson – or one of them – is that it pays to use whatever freedom you do have over your schedule not to "maximise your time" or "optimise your day", in some vague way, but specifically to **ringfence three or four hours of undisturbed focus (ideally when your energy levels are highest)**. Stop assuming that the way to make progress on your most important projects is to work for longer. And drop the perfectionistic notion that emails, meetings, digital distractions and other interruptions ought ideally to be whittled away to practically nothing. **Just focus on protecting four hours** – and don't worry if the rest of the day is characterised by the usual scattered chaos.* *The other, arguably more important lesson isn't so much a time management tactic as an internal psychological move: to **give up demanding more of yourself than three or four hours of daily high-quality mental work***- Oliver Burkeman, 4 hours. https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours 

“*What Bode was saying was this: **Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former.** The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity — it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. .” - Richard Hamming 1986 talk* http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html 

*“You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly. **I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote**.” Sam Altman Blog*

### ***"What are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?”***

“N*o one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best ‘problem taste’, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors” - “They(best founders/researchers) have a bias towards action and trying things, and they’re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t (importantly, this goes both ways—I’m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it). They are creative idea-generators—a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage." Sam Altman Blog* 

***“It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored. So think about it more! Independent thought is hard but it’s something you can get better at with practice.” - Sam Altman Blog***

“**Great work requires teams.** Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. **The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish**. **An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.” - Sam Altman Blog**

*“Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.” “Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.” Sam Altman Blog*

*“One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself.”*

*“Focus is a force multiplier on work. Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter. **Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.**” “Let yourself grow more ambitious, and **don’t be afraid** to work on what you really want to work on.” Sam Altman Blog*

*“The most counterintuitive secret about startups is that it’s often easier to succeed with a hard startup than an easy one. A hard startup requires a lot more money, time, coordination, or technological development than most startups. A good hard startup is one that will be valuable if it works (not all hard problems are worth solving!).” Sam Altman Blog*

*“**Part of the magic of Silicon Valley is that people default to taking you seriously if you’re willing to be serious—they’ve learned it’s a very expensive mistake, in aggregate, not to.**  **If you want to start a company working on a better way to build homes, gene editing, artificial general intelligence, a new education system, or carbon sequestration, you may actually be able to get it funded, even if you don’t have a degree or much experience.***

***Let yourself become more ambitious—figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step. You don’t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars.***

*Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing.  Most people aren’t, which is part of the reason they pick “easy” startups.  In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you’re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you’ll have a very large edge.” Sam Altman Blog*

“*When you identify such a mess, the natural inclination of many people is to shy away, to find something that is easier to understand. But a field that is a mess is really an opportunity. Chances are good that there are deep unifying and simplifying concepts still waiting to be understood and developed by someone — perhaps you.”* “*There is little that is more important in research than building forward momentum” - “Even if peo- ple have spent enough time on self-development that they have a realistic chance of attacking big problems, they still may not. The reason is that they have a fear of working on something unsuccessfully.”* Principles of effective research - Michael A. Nielsen

“The keys to success are working on the right problems, making continual progress on them, and achieving continual personal growth. This essay is comprised of three sections, each covering one of these topics.”, “Goal-driven. Develop a vision of some new AI capabilities you’d like to achieve, and solve problems that bring you closer to that goal.”- John Schulmann - Opinionated Guide to ML Research 

### ***Idea-Driven vs Goal-Driven Research***

*Roughly speaking, there are two different ways that you might go about deciding what to work on next.*

1. *Idea-driven. Follow some sector of the literature. As you read a paper showing how to do X, you have an idea of how to do X even better. Then you embark on a project to test your idea.*
2. *Goal-driven. Develop a vision of some new AI capabilities you’d like to achieve, and solve problems that bring you closer to that goal. (Below, I give a couple case studies from my own research, including the goal of using reinforcement learning for 3D humanoid locomotion.) In your experimentation, you test a variety of existing methods from the literature, and then you develop your own methods that improve on them.*

*Of course, these two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Any given subfield ML is concerned with some goals (e.g., object detection). Any “idea-driven” project will represent progress towards the subfield’s goals, and thus in a sense, it’s an instance of goal-driven research. But here, I’ll take goal-driven research to mean that your goal is more specific than your whole subfield’s goal, and it’s more like make X work for the first time than make X work better.*

*I personally recommend goal-driven research for most people, and I’ve mostly followed this strategy myself.*

*One major downside of idea-driven research is that there’s a high risk of getting scooped or duplicating the work of others. Researchers around the world are reading the same literature, which leads them to similar ideas. To make breakthroughs with idea-driven research, you need to develop an exceptionally deep understanding of your subject, and a perspective that diverges from the rest of the community—some can do it, but it’s difficult.*

*On the other hand, with goal-driven research, your goal will give you a perspective that’s differentiated from the rest of the community. It will lead you to ask questions that no one else is asking, enabling you to make larger leaps of progress. Goal driven research can also be much more motivating. You can wake up every morning and imagine achieving your goal—what the result would look like and how you would feel. That makes it easier to stick to a long-running research program with ups and downs. Goals also make it possible for a team of researchers to work together and attack different aspects of the problem, whereas idea-driven research is most effectively carried out by “teams” of 1-2 people.* John Schulmann - Opinionated Guide to ML Research 

*Sometimes, people who are both exceptionally smart and hard-working fail to do great research. In my view, the main reason for this failure is that they work on unimportant problems. When you embark on a research project, you should ask yourself: how large is the potential upside? Will this be a 10% improvement or a 10X improvement? I often see researchers take on projects that seem sensible but could only possibly yield a small improvement to some metric.*John Schulmann - Opinionated Guide to ML Research 

***Without owning something, over an extended period of time, like a few years, where one has a chance to take responsibility for one's recommendation, where one has to see one’s recommendation through all action stages, and accumulate scar tissue for the mistakes and pick oneself off the ground and dust oneself off, one learns a fraction of what one can. Coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results, not owning the implementation, is a fraction of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better.** You do get a broad cut at companies, but it’s very thin, it’s like a picture of a banana. You might get a very accurate picture but it’s only two dimensional. And without the experience of actually doing it, you never get 3 dimensional. So you might have a lot of pictures on your wall, and you can show them off to your friends, I have worked in bananas, in peach, in grapes, but you never really taste it. - Steve Jobs on Consulting.*
