What is technology? 

Looking back, I am  surprised by how little I understood technology and how narrowly I defined it. Technology is not just the iPhone sitting on our desks, the internet we consume, or the cars we drive. Technology instead is technique, it's the way we do things. Working our way back through time, we notice that technology has existed for hundreds of thousand of years, limited only by the imagnitive capability of our ancestors to make new tools to better leverage their environment. 

Early on, our ancestors were limited by the energy that their own body generated by digesting food. This changed about 300,000 years back, when they discovered fire and learned to control it, using it for cooking, safety and warmth. Why was this significant? It was the first time that our ancestors had access to extrasomatic energy, an energy source external to their own body. Controlled used of fire was the first and most original piece of technology. 

Fast forward to 10,000 years back and we have the first evidence of crop cultivation. Curiously, this was the first time humans directly leveraged the sun's energy, using it to power photosynthesis, converting light from the sun into chemical energy that could power their bodies. We were no longer limited by indirect methods of consuming solar radiation via foraging. 

Starting around 9 millennia ago, we domesticated animals, allowing us to lift and move heavy load. We were no longer limited by our own energy to move ourselves, or to cultivate our lands. 

It's no surprise that all three of these significant technological shifts were energy related. Humans need energy to survive and thrive. At rest, a human weighing ~70 kilograms requires approximately 80 watts of power for their body to function, which translates to 6.9 megajoules of food energy or 1,650 kilocalorie per day. Finding this energy purely by foraging typically involved travelling tens of kilometers to support a small family. By leveraging agriculture, humans could live a relatively settled life. With the agricultural revolution, population densities increased by 2 orders of magnitude compared to foraging societies from 2-3 people per square kilometer to 150-200 people per square kilometer. 

As we built more settled societies, we began to find finding several other new ways of doing things. Principal among these was the discovery of writing 5,000 years ago, allowing us to preserve knowledge and communicate across time and space. 

Around the same time, 5,000 years ago, with the invention of sails, humans started leveraging a new significant source of energy, wind, on top of the three I mentioned earlier: thermal energy from wood, solar energy from the sun, mechanical energy from domesticated animals. 


In fact it was not until 400 years ago, with the onset of the industrial revolution, ).

Sails - 5,000 years ago

Waterwheels - 2,000 years ago

Windmills - 1,000 years ago
