Creating a demo for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is easy, but building a production-grade app is 10x harder, if not more. For every blog and tutorial claiming to get you started with RAG apps or agents in less than an hour, there are hundreds more talking about the complexity of building LLM, and RAG systems that operate reliably at an acceptable accuracy and latency while staying within budget.

So why is this hard? Let's imagine you want to build a production grade RAG pipeline. You first need to build an optimal data parsing and ingestion system. Then you have to embed your parsed data using the right embedding model(s). Once the data is ingested, you need to use an appropriate retrieval method and the right LLM with an optimal prompt to get the response you want. 

Every choice you make affects the performance of your RAG pipeline. Typical questions on your mind when building the system would be "which parser is the correct choice for my PDF that has both text and tables in it?", "what is the right chunk size for my use case?", "which embedding model would best fit my needs", "what type of retrieval method should I use", "how many results should I retrieve", "should I use a reranker", "which LLM makes sense for my use case". Perhaps the naive choice may work well when asking simple questions over a short document but this won't work for hard questions over complex documents. The system is hard to improve, and there are too many parameters to tune by hand, and on top of that you need reliable evaluation methods in place to measure performance. 

We don’t have to go far to see examples of this. OpenAI, [on their Devday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y), pointed towards the iterative nature of RAG optimization. While building a RAG pipeline for an enterprise client, OpenAI observed a baseline accuracy of 45%. The OpenAI engineers then tried multiple approaches to improve accuracy including trying Hypothetical Document Embeddings, Fine-Tuning Embeddings, and experimenting with different chunk sizes to better capture relevant information. After approximately 20 iterations, they had only reached 65% accuracy. At this point, they faced the decision to either abandon the project or continue optimizing. They chose to continue, applying cross-encoders to re-rank search results, using metadata to improve context relevance, doing further Prompt Engineering, integrating a tool (SQL database), and using Query Expansion. Eventually, by trying all these methods, and persisting with the ones that pushed the accuracy upward they managed to reach 98% accuracy.

Nvidia released a [paper in July 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07858v1) with the title “FACTS About Building Retrieval Augmented Generation-based Chatbots”. Nvidia mentioned that they identified 15 different control points in a RAG pipeline and each one of these control points impacts the quality of the results generated. They found that, among other parameters, choosing the right query rewriting strategy, chunk size, pre-processing technique, metadata enrichment, reranking, and LLM all mattered to the final performance. The retrieval relevance determined the accuracy of the LLM response. And retrieval relevance itself was dependent on metadata enrichment, chunking and query rephrasal.

The Solution: 

We built Queryloop out of frustration with the endless manual tuning required to turn RAG/LLM demos into production-ready apps. Our no-code platform automatically explores a wide range of configurations—adjusting chunk sizes, embedding models, rerankers, top‑k settings, chunking strategies, LLM parameters, and more—to optimize your RAG pipeline. 

Queryloop features a No-Code, Seamless Integration: Queryloop connects its built-in modules—retrieval and generation—to build complex RAG apps without writing a single line of code.
    
- Retrieval Tool: Easily tweak chunk sizes, embedding models, rerankers, and more to extract the best context from your data.
    
- Generation Tool: Compare different LLMs (fine-tuned or not), adjust temperature, experiment with prompt styles, and more.
    
- Dashboard: Monitor each experiment’s accuracy, latency, and cost in real time, then deploy the best-performing configuration with one click.
    

Why It’s Different  
Instead of guessing and manually scripting, Queryloop’s AutoML approach systematically tests a wide range of configurations. This lets you focus on building great features while we handle the heavy lifting of optimization—and we’re continuously evolving. We're actively adding new tools, like web search integration, and we’ll soon roll out optimization of agentic workflow to further streamline your workflows.
