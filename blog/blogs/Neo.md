The possibility of creating production-grade AI agentic workflows increases with the release of each new reasoning model along with improvements in the models’ ability to call tools. Work traditionally performed by humans can now start to get offloaded to these AI agents. 

In this sense, the Software 2.0 era, where the computer effectively writes the code and executes the task is closing in. This also means that the Software as a Service era, where the software assisted the human agent, will slowly get augmented and replaced by the Service as Software era. In the Service as Software era, the ai agent(s), with access to tools, will look to achieve a high level, abstract goal traditionally left to humans. This represents a major disruption in how humans have viewed their relationship with computers. AI agents with access to capital, can now redirect capital to get human labor to help them execute tasks. 

Many roles traditionally held by humans in corporations will undergo disruption. Well defined roles such as Sales Development Representative or Customer Support are already undergoing a nonlinear change. But in this write up, I want to focus on the AI/ML engineer. What could be more disruptive than the AI agent acting as an AI/ML engineer, resulting in the virtuous feedback loop where the agent improve its own capability? 

How could one go about building an AI/ML engineer? Let’s call him Neo.**
