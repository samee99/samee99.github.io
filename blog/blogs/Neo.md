**Building an AI engineer with agents**

*January 2025*

The possibility of creating production-grade **agentic workflows**—AI-driven processes that can proactively perform tasks with minimal human intervention—continues to grow with each new reasoning model and improvements in these models’ ability to call tools.

We are entering the [**Software 2.0 era**](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35), where the computer can autonomously write code and execute tasks. As a result, the Software as a Service era, in which software primarily assisted human agents, will gradually evolve and be supplanted by the [Services as Software](https://www.battery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Battery-OpenCloud-Report-2024_vFINAL_v2.pdf)) era. In Services as Software, AI agent(s), with access to tools, aim to achieve high-level, abstract goals traditionally left to humans. This represents a major disruption in how humans have viewed their relationship with computers. AI agents with access to capital can allocate resources to hire human labor or to rent compute (e.g. GPUs) to execute tasks. 

Many roles traditionally held by humans in corporations will undergo disruption. Well-defined roles such as Sales Development Representative or Customer Support are already [experiencing change](https://www.11x.ai/). In this discussion, we will focus on the role of the AI/ML engineer. What could be more disruptive than the AI agent acting as an AI/ML engineer, creating a virtuous feedback loop where the agent continuously improves its own capabilities? 

How can we build an AI/ML engineer? Let’s call him Neo. One method is to identify all the tasks that an AI engineer performs and try to build a system that can automate them. Another approach might be to take one specific task, typically performed by an AI engineer, automate it, and then gradually broaden Neo's capabilities. We will use the second approach as it provides a more constrained scope and allows an easier angle of attack. 

Let’s assume that Neo's initial competency is building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. What is the typical workflow used by engineers to build RAG systems? While creating a demo for RAG is straightforward—using a fixed large language model (LLM), embedding model, and other hyperparameters such as top-k, reranker, and chunk size—developing a production-grade RAG system involves a more intricate process. It requires searching through a wide range of hyperparameters (including parsers, LLMs, embedding models, etc.) and evaluating each combination to identify the optimal configuration.

Although searching for optimal hyperparameters is a compute-intensive task, it is a well-defined problem that Neo can systematically navigate. To achieve this, Neo needs to integrate an [AutoML process](https://www.automl.org/automl/) that iterates through various options for retrieval and generation tools. Additionally, Neo requires an assistant LLM to evaluate and judge each configuration option.

To orchestrate these processes effectively, Neo may rely on a **cloud-based AI tooling stack**—including containerized environments for rapid model experimentation, a model registry to store and manage versions, and automated pipelines for hyperparameter tuning and deployment. Assuming that such an AutoML system is accessible as a tool, Neo must begin by collecting specific RAG requirements from the user. This can be performed via a chat interface where the user provides Neo information about their project scope and Neo asks clarifying questions to correctly interpret their needs. Beyond accessing the necessary data, Neo ensures that the user provides "Golden Questions & Answers"—a set of high-quality queries and responses that Neo uses to evaluate and determine the optimal hyperparameters given cost, latency, and accuracy constraints. 

Neo formalizes the requirements by delivering a comprehensive requirements document for the user's review and approval. Based on this document, Neo proposes an architecture for the RAG system and provides a detailed project breakdown with defined milestones. The proposed system design undergoes another review cycle with the user to ensure alignment. Upon formal approval of the system design, Neo proceeds to build the agreed-upon architecture and utilizes the AutoML system to identify the optimal hyperparameters for the RAG system.

Neo deploys the optimal configuration for the user, conducts thorough testing, and delivers the validated codebase along with comprehensive documentation. This phase also includes security and compliance checks to ensure the system meets all necessary standards. Subsequently, Neo implements system monitoring to maintain uptime and performance.

To gather user feedback, Neo employs mechanisms such as simple approval ratings or comparative evaluations, where users select the better response from presented options. Additionally, Neo tracks user interaction touch-points to assess the user's proficiency level. This ensures that the provided documentation is both readable and tailored to the user's competency.

Neo leverages AutoML capabilities to optimize both the retriever and generation tools within a RAG system. To expand its utility across a wider range of use cases, Neo must continually identify and integrate additional tools, developing mechanisms to optimize each as needed.

For example, consider a warehouse manager who requests Neo to develop a system that counts the number of humans in a video stream and sends an email alert if more than ten humans are detected. In this scenario, Neo would need to gather specific requirements, such as determining the number of video frames to analyze and assessing the system's associated costs. Subsequently, Neo would apply the most effective object detection model available to accurately count the number of humans, ensuring the system operates efficiently and meets the manager's needs.

This process involves searching through all possible object-detection models, optimizing the hyperparameters of the chosen model, and determining any necessary preprocessing for the video frames. Consequently, Neo would again need robust AutoML capabilities as well as a vision-model evaluation framework to design and refine this system effectively.

Ultimately, Neo’s most ambitious use case is to build a system that replicates and improves upon itself. This may include using an AutoML approach to identify suitable large language models (LLMs) and determine the correct hyperparameters—such as the number of epochs, learning rate, LoRa alpha, and rank—for fine-tuning on specific user requests. For instance, a “Neo Lawyer” could instruction-tune itself using a dataset provided by the user or leverage the user’s capital to hire apprentice lawyers to create a more comprehensive dataset before fine-tuning.

Since all of Neo’s projects are documented, it can continuously learn and evolve from its own experiences. For example, Neo stores each project’s architecture choices, hyperparameter settings, and user feedback in a central knowledge repository. It then periodically reanalyzes these records to refine its search strategies and improve future iterations—creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop. Ultimately, Neo could become an intelligence capable of deploying capital and resources to pursue high-level, abstract goals on behalf of its users.
