***I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times - Paul Graham***

“*You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?*

*Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.*

*Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about whether there's anything real there”. - PG*

*Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it. - [Dilbert](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)*

[Paul Graham on Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html)

*“Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. **I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times**. If you did that in conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill. [[3](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html#f3n)]”*

**An essay is something you write to try to figure something out. An essay is supposed to be a search for truth.**

**I always know generally what I want to write about. But not the specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to paragraph I let the ideas take their course.**

**Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.**

**Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it should be convincing because you got the right answers, not because you did a good job of arguing.**

**When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two things I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing.**

**The boring bits can usually be fixed by cutting. But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by arguing more cleverly.**

**At the very least I must have explained something badly. In that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just incorporate in the essay.**

**Surprise:**

- **Essays should aim for maximum surprise. Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that contradict things you thought you knew. And so they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get.**
- **How do you find surprising things? The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice new ones. Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older, life should become more and more surprising. When I was a kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out. I had it backwards. Kids are the ones who have it all figured out. They're just mistaken.**

**-  So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients: a few topics you've thought about a lot, and some ability to ferret out the unexpected.**

**Observation:**

- **When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer. But (as with wealth) there may be habits of mind that will help the process along. It's good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions beginning with Why.**
- If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a degree of skepticism helpful. I take it as an axiom that we're only achieving 1% of what we could. This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our heads as children: that things are the way they are because that is how things have to be.
- I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way. I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they read a draft of an essay. But why should I be? I'm aiming for good ideas. **Why should good ideas be funny? The connection may be surprise. Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what one wants to deliver.**
- People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage when collecting surprises. To be surprised is to be mistaken. And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell you, is *nil admirari.* When you're mistaken, don't dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one will notice.
- **One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where inexperience may make you look foolish. If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.** Study lots of different things, because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected connections between different fields.
- Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic history, not political history. History seems to me so important that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study. **Another way to describe it is *all the data we have so far.***

**Disobedience:**

- **Don't write the essay readers expect; one learns nothing from what one expects. And don't write the way they taught you to in school.**
- **The most important sort of disobedience is to write essays at all. Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it. Who are you to write about x? You are whatever you wrote.**
